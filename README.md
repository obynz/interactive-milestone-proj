Frontend Milestone Project

This project is my first Milestone project to describe a 1960s band that want an internet presence displaying all their events from pictures, videos and audios.
The website has also taken into consideration events, blogs and a contact us system so they can be booked for events. I have also included links to their social platforms

UX

I used Balsamic to create a wireframe of what the evntual site will look like and in addition; it is for a 1960s band that want an internet presence displaying all their events from pictures, videos and audios.
The website has also taken into consideration events, blogs and a contact us system so they can be booked for events. I have also included links to their social platforms

The user story includes - 
    viewing the website
    
    links and access to profiles of band members
    
    listening to recorded audio content
    
    watching past video contents
    
    viewing pictures of the band at events
    
    booking the band for events
    
    reading their blog stories

Features

The features were initially  based around the mini project as my first entry into creating modern website. This gave be some leverage as to where to start from. Implemented features were based mainly around HTML, CSS using frmaeworks from W3School such as Bootstrap, FontAwesome, creating mp3 audio and mp4 videos. Future enhancements will see the addition of javasript and 
backend databases.

This will help me develop features like

    Booking using the contact us form
    
    Contact Us
    
    Timeline Events
    
    Picture page
    
    Video page
    
    Music page for their audio files
    


Contact form:
At this time, the contact us page is just a plain form filed page which shows the potential for interracting with a backend system. I have only used the knowledge gained to get me to this point of
of my study so far. With future lessons, I may go back and enable more advanced features.


Deployment

The development version has been done solely using Cloud9 IDE with integration into Github. The production version will be deployed using Github Pages. This will be achieved by going into settings for this particular repository, scrolling down to Github Pages
and selecting the master branch where this repository resides. The website is hosted on github at https://obynz.github.io/fe-milestone-project/

The code itself can be run within Cloud 9 by selecting the correct html page and clicking the run button at the top of the page. A URL is displayed at the bottom of the page
which displays the link to click to and get to the published development website.

Bugs

Due to time wasted on my part due to external work commitment and to save time; some bugs and errors found as a result of running this through jigsaw have been left unsolved. I hoping I get better at this as I progress.
